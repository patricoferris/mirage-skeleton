# Introduction

Welcome! This book contains many examples of [MirageOS](https://mirage.io) unikernels. MirageOS is a library operating system that constructs unikernels for secure, high-performance network applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms.

<strong>
  <p> Work in Progress</strong>: Whilst this repository and the unikernels have been around for a long time, the documentation is currently a work in progress. Each example has a corresponding <code>README.md</code> explaining the unikernel and its configuration.</p>
  <p>Help is wanted to completed the documentation! You can fork [the repository](https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton) and update the <code>README.md</code> of whatever page you would like to update.</p>
